# ChebyExpansions.jl
## Introduction
In this package, we implement the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) in Julia, an efficient technique to compute spectral and correlation functions using order-N Chebyshev expansions of said quantities. 

Diagonalization in KPM is replaced by matrix multiplications and, thus, the resource consumption for a given precission drops to $\mathcal{O}(D)$ for sparse or $\mathcal{O}(D^2)$ for dense matrices, being $D$ the matrix dimension. 

In this regard, this technique is well suited for **large matrix calculations** where exact diagonalization becomes too expensive. In addition, KPM offers some advantages in terms of stability and resource consumption with respect to other recursive methods such as Lanczos-based techniques, see [1] for a comprehensive review. 

## Practical considerations

1. The energy resolution is controlled by the ratio $W/N$, where $W$ is the bandwidth of $H$ and $N$ the expansion order. The complexity for sparse matrices goes like $\mathcal O(ND)$
2. The error in the stochastic trace estimation $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{DR})$, being R the number of random kets considered.


## Observables 

Currently, given a hamiltonian matrix, $H$ and a generic operator $A$ the following methods are implemented:

* Momenta computation corresponding to traces over the product of Chebyshev polynomials of $H$ and $A$: $\mu_n = \text{Tr}[A T_n(H)]$.
* Calculation of spectral densities of an operator $A(E) = \text{Tr} [A ùõø(E-H)]$.
* Calculation of thermal averages, i.e. $\langle A\rangle _{E_F} = \text{Tr} [A f(H,E_F)]$
